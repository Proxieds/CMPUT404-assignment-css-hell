            Fun Facts about Me
        </h1>
        <h3>
            I Enjoy Playing video games
        </h3>
        <p>
            I mainly play <span>Lost Ark</span> right now but looking forwards to <span>Elden Ring</span>.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>
            I like watching anime
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have been watching anime ever since my childhood. My favorite one this season is <span>Attack on Titan</span>.
        </p><br/>
        <h3>
            I study some Chinese and Japanese everyday
        </h3>
        <p>
            I want to be able to survive when travelling to these countries in the future with my limited classroom knowledge. Also would like to watch anime without subtitles.
        </p><br/>
        <h3>
            My favorite fruit is Mango
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mangos are sweet and easy to eat with cutting them into cubes. My most disliked fruit on the contrary are eggplants due to their bitter taste and slimy texture.

                I am specializing in computing science as well as pursuing the games development certificate here at the UofA. I decided to study computing science because
                I have been using computers my entire life and figured that dedicating myself to something I'm passionate about would be a good life decision. Especially with how everything lives on
                the internet these days, having knowledge in computers as well as software has become an invaluable asset.

                I try to work using the best practices that I have learned throughout my undergraduate and internship to improve workflows and code quality. I am capable and easy to work with as a 
                team member, I try to ask for opinions before making big changes and make sure that everyone is onboard with implementation ideas. I try to accomodate as much as I can to help fellow
                co-workers out in times of need whether it's for debugging code or configuring their work environments.
